# Hello!

<!-- About me XD-->

## About me

Hi! Whoever you are, you are one of the few people who actually stumble upon my GitHub page.

Anyway, my name is Kimi, and I currently live in the U.S. and I've been coding for the past 2 years due to covid

## Overall Coding experience

I enjoy coding, but I don't just don't like training consistently on it. I like to keep it as a hobby and come to it
whenever I feel like it. I'm not the type of guy who would give an exact answer, but coding is pretty fun and if you
have an interest, go for it because you can learn a lot :)

## Python Experience

Python was my first programming language, and is by far the easiest.

This was my first and (probably) favorite programming language for 3 main reasons:

> Easy to program in

> Easy to read and run/compile (for nerds)

> I can lose more coding competitions because of how slow it is :D

## Java Experience

I don't have a lot of Java experience (for now), because it's not my main language, but I'll give you an over all
experience:

> Quite easy to program

> Slightly harder to compile/run (or build) if you're using VSCode

> Still would lose competitions because I don't know how to use this language to its finest

## C++ Experience

Where to even start...I first started wanted to learn C++ when I saw how painfully slow my code was in Python, so I gave
C++ a try. Instant regret. It's extremely hard to learn with a big (almost exponential) learning curve, and it's hard to
remember everything (this was also an issue for Java ofcourse).

> Not so easy to program

> Ehh on the compiling part, but I used VSCode so yeah (I didn't like Visual Studio)

> Fast, but lengthy

> Good for competitive programming

## HTML Experience

Well, I first started coding in HTML thinking that it was so easy to integrate Python with the website, but it's harder
(obviously) harder than I thought. [Website](https://us-east-1.tixte.net/uploads/kimigets0fps.needs.rest/home.html)

> A pretty easy programming language

> Good to use with CSS

> Good for those who are interested in website building

## C# Experience

I first started using this language was because of a game engine called Unity. But I soon abandoned the project and made
this project private (which is why you can't see it)

> Basically C++ but with a large library for game developing (if used with Unity and don't quote me on this)
