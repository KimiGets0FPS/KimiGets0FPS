# Hello!

<!-- About me XD-->

## About me

My name is Zhewei, more well known as Kimi, and I currently live in the U.S. and I've been coding for the past 2 years due to covid

## Overall Coding experience

I enjoy coding, and I like to keep it as a hobby and come to it whenever I feel like it. Coding is pretty fun and if you
have an interest, go for it because you can learn a lot :)

Coding <333

## Python Experience

Python was my first programming language, and is by far the easiest.

This was my first and (probably) favorite programming language for 3 main reasons:

> Easy to program in

> Easy to read and run/compile (for nerds)

> I can lose more coding competitions because of how slow it is :D

## Java Experience

I don't have a lot of Java experience (for now), because it's not my main language, but I'll give you an over all
experience:

> Quite easy to program

> Slightly harder to compile/run (or build) if you're using VSCode

> Still would lose competitions because I don't know how to use this language to its finest

## C++ Experience

Where to even start...I first started wanted to learn C++ when I saw how painfully slow my code was in Python, so I gave
C++ a try. Instant regret. It's extremely hard to learn with a big (almost exponential) learning curve, and it's hard to
remember everything (this was also an issue for Java ofcourse).

> Not so easy to program

> Ehh on the compiling part, but I used VSCode so yeah (I didn't like Visual Studio)

> Fast, but lengthy

> Good for competitive programming

## HTML Experience

Well, I first started coding in HTML thinking that it was so easy to integrate Python with the website, but it's harder
(obviously) harder than I thought. [Website](https://us-east-1.tixte.net/uploads/kimigets0fps.needs.rest/home.html) 
WEBSITE WARNING: VERY OUTDATED (and very cringey)!!!

> A pretty easy programming language

> Good to use with CSS

> Good for those who are interested in website building

## C# Experience

I first started using this language was because of a game engine called Unity. But I soon abandoned the project and made
this project private (which is why you can't see it)

> Basically C++ but with a large library for game developing (if used with Unity and don't quote me on this)
